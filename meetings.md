## Meetings
### 2022-04-12 at 15:00
- Attendees: Nicholas, Nathan, Sarah
- Team Brainstorm (<=1hr)
  All three attendees collaborated to form a general blueprint of the project. We discussed what functional and non-functional requirements we wanted to implement. We also tried to determine which requirements (functional and non-functional) could be deemed as HP. Further discussion on Discord to organize a meeting time that worked for all four members.
  - <Nathan> Add name/username to readme file. Flesh out requirements file and add required packages.
  - <Nicholas> Add name/username to readme file. Implement custom css and bootstrap. Add main block content.
  - <Sarah> Add name/username to readme file. Update meetings file.
  - <Selim> Add name/username to readme file.

  - No pair-programming to report
  - Group was able to come to a consensus on the overall layout and functionality of the website. Ensured that we had enough functional and non-functional requirements to satisfy Milestone 1. Determined a day which all four members could meet. No prior updates available since this was the first meeting.
